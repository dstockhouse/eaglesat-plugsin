# Spacecraft 'Safe' Mode

In the event of a failure in one of the subsystems or the primary payload, the
spacecraft shall go into safe mode. In safe mode, the spacecraft shuts off all
subsystems not critical to the survival of the spacecraft, to consume less power
and prevent the continued operation of the system from causing more damage.
