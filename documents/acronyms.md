# List of Acronyms

This is a list of the acronyms found in documents in this directory. If you find
additional acronyms without a definition, please contact David Stockhouse to
remedy the situation.

## General
* ADC -- *Analog to Digital Converter*. A device that inputs an analog voltage
  signal and outputs a digital representation of the analog voltage.
* APS -- *Active Pixel Sensor*. A type of image sensor.
* ASIC -- *Application Specific Integrated Circuit*. An integrated circuit
  designed to meet the requirements of a specific application. ASICs can be
programmed on an FPGA or fabricated on "hard" non-reprogrammable silicon in a
fabrication facility.
* CMOS -- *Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor*. A technology for
  semiconductor manufacturing.
* CMOSIS -- *CMOS Image Sensors*. Imaging solutions company acquired by ams
  Sensor Solutions. Supplier of the CMV2000 CMOS APS.
* CMV2000 -- A CMOS APS supplied by CMOSIS and used by CRP to detect and
  characterize cosmic particles in low-Earth orbit.
* CRP -- *Cosmic Ray Payload*. The primary payload on EagleSat-2.
* EPS -- *Electronic Power System*. The subsystem on EagleSat-2 responsible for
  supplying power to the payloads and other subsystems.
* FOT -- *Frame Overhead Time*. The time taken by the CMV2000 to sample and
  convert analog signals from light integrated on the pixels of the sensor.
* FPGA -- *Field-Programmable Gate Array*. A device containing many cells of
  configurable logic blocks and interconnections. It can be programmed to
perform the functionality of any digital circuit, and reprogrammed more than
once.
* LVDS -- *Low-Voltage Differential Signaling*. A physical layer for
  transmission of digital signals where each bit transferred is carried on two
wires, positive and negative, instead of one. The two wires have a slight
differential voltage between them. The bit carried is determined by which wire
is positive with respect to the other.
* MDE -- *Memory Degradation Experiment*. The secondary payload on EagleSat-2.
* PLL -- *Phase-Locked Loop*. A device capable of multiplying an input clock
  signal to a higher frequency.
* SPI -- *Serial Peripheral Interface*. A digital data encoding scheme in which
  a single master device can communicate to multiple slaves by sending and
receiving synchronous data along transmission lines shared by all parties.
