# eaglesat-plugsin

Code for the EagleSat-2 project at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University,
Prescott, plugs-in prototype test. This is a public repository because having a
private repository is non-free, but edits will only be accepted by members of
EagleSat.

The project is intended to run with Xillybus on a Zynq-7020 SoC. Information and
tons of documentation can be found at xillybus.com

The C code running on Xillinux has been tested to a limited capacity. The FPGA
configuration for Vivado (2017?) still has yet to be completed and fully tested.
The Vivado project directories contain a lot of files for Vivado's use that
aren't necessary for editing for most purposes. 

Currently the project contains several redundant files and lots to be flushed
out, but that will be in the process of being fixed soon.
